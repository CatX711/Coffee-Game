*Last time I was caught out by tu2 for using a space in my file name, so I made sure to not make that mistake twice.*

*Here is the broken code:*

``
        # Code here has to be fixed:
        answer = input("How many coffee beans do you want? ")
        coffee_beans -= int(input())
        if coffee_beans > 7:
            Lots_of_coffee_beans = True
        answer = input("How many drops of milk do you want in your coffee? ")
        milk_droplets -= int(input())
        if milk_droplets > 27:
            Lots_of_milk_droplets = True
        answer = input("How many sugar cubes do you want in your coffee? ")
        sugar_cubes -= int(input())
        if sugar_cubes > 3:
            Lots_of_sugar_cubes = True
        print("Making...")
        sleep(3)
        print("Coffee done! Here are the results:")
        if Lots_of_coffee_beans == True:
            sleep(2)
            print("Too many coffee beans!")
        if Lots_of_milk_droplets == True:
            print("A bit too much milk!")
        if Lots_of_sugar_cubes == True:
            sleep(2)
            print("Too many sugar cubes!")
        elif Lots_of_coffee_beans == False:
            sleep(2)
            print("A good amount of coffee beans!")
        elif Lots_of_milk_droplets == False:
            sleep(2)
            print("Just the right amount of milk droplets!")
        elif Lots_of_sugar_cubes == False:
            sleep(2)
            print("You resisted the temptation for more sugar- good job!")
        print("Here are the resources you have left:")
        sleep(1)
        print("You have ", coffee_beans, " coffee beans left over,")
        sleep(1)
        print(milk_droplets, " milk droplets,")
        sleep(1)
        print("And finally, you have ", sugar_cubes, " sugar cubes left over." )
        sleep(1)
        print("Enjoy!")
        # Here is where the code that needs fixing ends.
